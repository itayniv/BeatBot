let lyrics = "She said shes heard stories and shes heard fables. That Im vicious on the mic and the turntable. This young reporter I did adore. So I rocked some vicious rhymes like I never did before. She said, damn, fly guy, Im in love with you. The Casanova legend must have been true. I said, by the way, baby, whats your name Said, I go by name of Lois Lane. And you could be my boyfriend. So real you so trill. baby everything legit. Now once she go black, she ain't never coming back. When I rock the stadium. I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse. You probably get sweaty. You should bring a extra tee. Now I’m standing next to Jay. I got my superman power, my superman cape. These the last hours, but superman late. The clock is ticking, damn can you wait? Man, will he come back and save the day? Fly across the earth, put things in reverse. I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse. Certain things I can't doctor, and you say I'm the worst. Back when Gucci was the shit to rock. Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop. I'd do anything to say I got it. Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket. Before anybody wanted K. West beats. Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC. Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns. Like Man, these fellas that much better than me?. Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane.Brand new truck, butter soft seat. Four point something with a low ride something. Ain't nothing better than to ride out the hood with it. Who looking better and damn you looking good in it.Take a chance with a fella in a choice ride. Listen to the CD's I play inside. Mos Def, Jay, Prince, and Stevie. Marvin Gaye, Led Zeppelin, and Biggie And when the evening is over love. Gonna find a nice spot for the rover love. Do things to make the man in the moon blush My mind race but I tell my waist don't rush. You's a upper echelon piece. So when you find its stashed then you don't freak. I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink. I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink. I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink. No, no, no I'm so tired, I don't know what to do. I'm so tired, my mind is set on you. I wonder should I call you but I know what you would doYou want to nibble on a fella ear.And I. don't know if I'll be back again. Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets. But when she came to kick it, things became. different. Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on. Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long. I'm trying to right my wrongs. But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song. Welcome to the good life, where fellas who sell D. Won't even get pulled over in they new V. The good life, let's go on. a living spree. Dragged a comb across my head.Found my way downstairs and drank a cup. And looking up I noticed I was late. Found my coat and grabbed my hat. Made the bus in seconds flat.Found my way upstairs and had a smoke. And somebody spoke and I went into a dreamShit, they say the best things in life are free. The good life, it feel like Atlanta. It feel like LA, it feel like Miami It feel like NY, summertime Chi. Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky).I saw the photograph.He blew his mind out in a car.He didn't notice that the lights had changed So I roll through good. Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari. And she got the goods. And she got that bottom, I got to look, sorry! I ain't.  I wish this life was a movie I could just rehearse. have enough patients, but I needed a nurse. What that nigga want, God? Word up, look out for the cops though. Wu-Tang five finger shit, Cash rules - Word up, two for fives over here, baby. Word up, two for fives, niggas got garbage down the way. Word up, know what I'm sayin'? Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. get- Yeah, check this old fly shit out, word up Cash rules everything around me C.R.E.A.M. get the money,dollar dollar bill, y'all Take you on a natural joint Here we here we go, check this shit, yo.

Please, nobody pinch me out this dream. Sent you a message, sent you an email,Hasty decisions we made still prevail, Both needed breaks, we both needed to bail, Walking through the corridors of my mind, The hideaways and nooks, and things with good times, Memories, certainly, yes, they still bind, Still a common man and yeah, that's for sure, Still a bankroll, and yeah, still couture, But man, this thing we had was much more, Come back home, don't be out in the world, It's a rat race an no place for a girl, Amongst the scavengers, I found a pretty pearl, It's for the faint of heart who never get enough, Gotta get tough, buckle em up, we call 'em duds, And we, and we, and we, ahhh!

And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep. A man with a dream with plans to make cream. Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen. A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much. Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not. The court played me short, now I face incarceration. Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination. Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us. Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough. But as the world turned I learned life is hell. Livin' in the world no different from a cell. Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase. Sellin' base, smokin' bones in the staircase, Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess. I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed. But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?. Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth. Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain. To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain. We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks. and stray shots, all on the block that stays hot. Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof. To kick the truth. to the young black youth. But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer. And ain't tryin' to hear what I'm kickin' in his ear. Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted. That what? That life is hectic";
